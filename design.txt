CSX Puzzle Solver, Project Part 2:  Water & Clock

Name: Julien Kirnes


1. Explain how your common solver is able to work with both puzzles.

It does not, was not able to make it work with both, but I know it would have involved
adapting to arrayLists all throughout the puzzles

2. What was the type of configuration you used for each puzzle?

I used an arrayList configuration

3. Starting with the Puzzle interface from part 1, what were the major
changes and additions you had to make?

I modified the neighbors so it took in ArrayList of integers and spit out ArrayList<ArrayList<Integer>>
I also modified start so it was an ArrayList<Integers>


4. What problems, if any, did you encounter when re-designing your 
project from part 1?

redesigning getNeighbors for water and redesigning the solver
